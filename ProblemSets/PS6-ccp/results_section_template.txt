4. Empirical Results

4.1 Data and Estimation

We apply our framework to the bus engine replacement data from Rust (1987). 
[Cite Table 1 for descriptive statistics]. The data contains replacement 
decisions for [N] buses over [T] periods. We estimate the model using the 
two-step CCP procedure proposed by Hotz and Miller (1993).

[Table 2 about here]

Table 2 presents our structural parameter estimates. The coefficient on 
odometer is negative and significant (θ̂_x = [value], SE = [value]), indicating 
that higher mileage reduces utility. The branded bus coefficient is [positive/negative], 
suggesting [interpretation].

4.2 Implicit State Prices

Using the estimated transition probabilities and discount factor β = 0.9, we 
compute implicit state prices q_d(x'|x) = β·f(x'|x,d) for both actions. 
Figure 1 illustrates the structure of these prices.

[Figure 1 about here]

Several patterns emerge. First, under the "keep" action (d=0), probability 
mass concentrates on higher mileage states, reflecting continued deterioration. 
Second, under "replace" (d=1), all probability mass shifts to the lowest 
mileage state, as the engine resets. Third, these different probability 
structures generate distinct implicit valuations of future states.

Table 3 presents the continuation values weighted by these implicit prices.

[Table 3 about here]

At low mileage states, the option value of replacement is [negative/positive] 
(EV_replace - EV_keep = [value]), indicating that continuation under the current 
engine dominates. As mileage increases, this option value [rises/falls], reaching 
[value] at high mileage states. The implicit premium—measuring the extra weight 
on unfavorable high-mileage states when keeping versus replacing—increases from 
[value] to [value] as current mileage rises.

[Figure 2 about here]

Figure 2 shows how option values vary across the entire mileage distribution. 
The relationship is [monotonic/non-monotonic], with [interpretation].

4.3 Heterogeneity in Implicit State Prices

Agents with different characteristics face different transition probabilities, 
generating heterogeneous implicit state prices. Table 4 compares branded versus 
non-branded buses.

[Table 4 about here]

Branded buses exhibit [higher/lower] continuation values under both actions. 
The option value of replacement differs by [value] units between groups, 
equivalent to [X]% of the baseline. This heterogeneity arises from [explanation: 
different failure rates, maintenance schedules, or usage patterns].

4.4 Willingness to Pay

We convert option values into dollar equivalents using the estimated marginal 
utility of mileage. Table 5 reports summary statistics.

[Table 5 about here]

On average, bus operators implicitly value avoiding high-mileage states at 
[value] per expected breakdown. This varies from [min] to [max] across 
states. Branded buses show [higher/lower] willingness to pay ([value] vs 
[value]), consistent with their [interpretation].

These estimates provide a revealed-preference measure of breakdown costs that 
does not require observing actual breakdown events or their direct costs.

4.5 Decomposition and Interpretation

Figure 3 decomposes the value function into flow utility and continuation 
components.

[Figure 3 about here]

The continuation value term, weighted by implicit state prices, accounts for 
[XX]% of total value at low mileage and [YY]% at high mileage. This demonstrates 
the quantitative importance of forward-looking behavior and shows how implicit 
state prices aggregate future outcomes into current decisions.

Our findings show that conditional choice probabilities, when properly scaled, 
reveal agents' implicit valuation of future states—analogous to how Arrow-Debreu 
prices reveal market valuations in complete markets. This "behavioral pricing 
kernel" provides a unified framework for understanding dynamic choice under 
uncertainty.
